# ADR 0006: Batched import records

Status: **accepted for implementation; batch publication remains closed.**
Date: 2026-11-07. This decision applies to import records only. Live scrobbles
and imported loves continue to use their existing single-record collections.

## Decision

Add the candidate schema `com.example.atmusic.scrobbleBatch`, configured at
runtime as `<prefix>.scrobbleBatch`. A batch is one repository record with a
`createdAt` envelope timestamp and 1–200 `listens`. Every entry has a unique
stable TID `id` and every field of a single scrobble except `$type`; this
includes the entry's own required `createdAt`. The core remote validator
reuses single-scrobble validation by synthesizing `<prefix>.scrobble` for each
entry. Invalid entries are dropped individually. Invalid envelope shape,
count, or duplicate valid IDs excludes the container. Unknown remote fields
remain ignored like single scrobbles.

The writer must cap a record at **64,000 DAG-CBOR bytes** and its exact
UTF-8-encoded `com.atproto.repo.createRecord` JSON body at **100,000 bytes**.
The body size includes `repo`, `collection`, `rkey`, and `record`; JavaScript
string length is not a byte count. `packages/core/src/scrobble-batch.ts`
exports the shared limits, record builder and validator, stable URI helpers,
and a stable-order packer. `packages/atproto/src/scrobble-batch-size.ts`
provides DAG-CBOR and exact request-body measurements for that packer.

An indexed listen identity is
`at://<did>/<prefix>.scrobbleBatch/<rkey>#<listenId>`. The fragment names an
AppView item, not an AT repository record. Proofs and repository operations
always use the fragment-free container URI. Helpers reject malformed DIDs,
collections, record keys, and TIDs.

## Publication and OAuth gate

The existing four-schema production receipt remains truthful and continues to
gate existing writes. Batch writes require the separate optional
`NAMESPACE_BATCH_PUBLICATION_REF=sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` setting in
addition to `NAMESPACE_PUBLICATION_REF`. The batch digest must differ from the
old digest and refer to a separately reviewed manifest containing successful
public retrieval evidence for all five production schemas, including
`<prefix>.scrobbleBatch`. Runtime validation checks the digest shape and
distinctness only; it is not remote cryptographic verification. With either
gate missing, batch publication is disabled. `meta.capabilities` adds
`batchPublication` only when both gates are open. OAuth metadata requests the
batch collection scope only under that same gate, so existing sessions must
reauthorize before writing batches.

The checked-in batch lexicon is an unpublished candidate. No publication,
record write, PDS request, or production environment change is part of this
ADR. See [publication instructions](../verification/lexicon-publication/README.md).

## Scope boundary

This foundation slice does not add ingestion projection, database migration,
outbox writing, import rebatching, or deletion behavior. Later slices must
preserve listen provenance, proof guards, atomic container replacement, and
the worker/queue lifecycle decisions in `/tmp/atmusic-batch-design.md`.
Existing single scrobble writes remain unchanged. No `web/` work is included;
the UI will need a later capability-aware import update.
